# Machine-Learning-Quarter-1-Project
Luke Flecker and Tanush Kallem

This paper presents a machine learning project that developed models to predict crime codes in Los Angeles using data from 2020 onwards. The authors implemented various data preprocessing techniques including missing value replacement, attribute selection methods such as CfsSubsetEval and ReliefFAttributeEval, and tested multiple classifier models including Naive Bayes, DecisionTable, J48, and Random Forest. The project demonstrates the application of machine learning to crime data analysis with potential implications for improving public safety and resource allocation in law enforcement.
